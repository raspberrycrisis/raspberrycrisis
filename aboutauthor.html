            <p class="infotext">Lianxia is a university student. Her family background has given her a familiarity
                with both English and Mandarin that has been present ever since her childhood, which has given her
                an interest in and dedication to translation. She enjoys playing video games and drawing on occasion,
                with a particular focus on creating Original Character (OC) content. She loves slit pupils in character
                designs and stories about effectively immortal inhuman beings living as humans. She also has an interest
                in the Touhou Project and Guilty Gear games.</p>

                first long-term project.</p>
