        <h2>ABOUT THE STORY</h2>

        <p class="infotextquote">“It’s always summer when I’m with you.”</p>

        <p class="infotext"><span class="specialtext">A Certain Eternal Summer</span> is a webcomic and prose
            project that began as a inside joke with a friend, an interest in folklore—particularly Southeast Asian
            folklore—and as a way of coping with homesickness. It is a story about the transient yet everlasting bliss
            that summer often represents, finding a place for yourself in the world that you can be proud of, and, as
            many other stories are, people whom you can call home. Lianxia draws upon her own experiences of growing up
            in a place where she never felt truly accepted—but which she nonetheless loved dearly—to create a setting
            and story that is a blend of the memories she holds dear and the life she wishes she could lead back home.
            This project is as much of a bittersweet love letter to her home country as it is a way for her to fulfill
            her childhood self’s desire—of seeing that whether it was real or not, somewhere out there, there was
            someone like her living a life she could find peace in.</p>

        <p class="infotext">Lianxia hopes that her characters will bring even one person joy, as they have for her.</p>
