        <h2>STORY SUMMARY</h2>
        <p class="infotextquote">
            “Do you think you could be my friend in this vast, unrelenting world, for as long as the tides still change
            as the moon calls them home?”
        </p>

        <p class="infotext">
            A sunny slice-of-life with a side of melancholy and monsters, <span class="specialtext">A Certain Eternal
                Summer</span> follows one Aster Bai Wen in the years after she relocates to a small
            tropical city in search of something new. Aster—who is a <span class="specialtext">shé jīng</span> (snake
            spirit), and effectively immortal because of it—isn’t all that certain exactly what she’s looking for, but
            she is determined to build a new life for herself nonetheless. As a human. It is this decision that leads to
            Aster finding herself falling—not head-over-heels nor suddenly, but still unequivocally—into a world of
            colourful, interesting characters. A lizard boy in her fridge, a <span class="specialtext">hantu air</span>
            (water ghost) next door, a dhampir living downstairs, and an oddly familiar <span class="specialtext">hú lí
                jīng</span> (fox spirit)… it is with a flutter of the heartstrings that Aster comes to realise that
            perhaps, the red string of fate has seen it fit to help her find what she sought after all.
        </p>

        <p class="infotext">
            <span class="specialtext">A Certain Eternal Summer</span> offers a glimpse into a lively
            world of magical realism as Aster, like countless protagonists before her, cries and laughs and lives and
            feels the full brunt of life. She, and much of the cast, must contend with the looming promise of forever
            and the stagnancy it invites while still learning to deal with the inevitable changes that life brings, each
            in their own way. They have at least a couple of lifetimes to kill, anyway. Why not join them for a bit of
            one?
